#+title: Quiet Walking Dev Notes

* Sensor Model

Simulating individual phonons is unusably slow with Hoot. I'll need something higher level instead. So let's say I've got a "sonar ping" notion which has a radius and 1000(?) sample points. Whenever the ping sweeps past an object, that ping gets sent back home and the samples overlapping that object's bounding circle get removed.

* Goals

"Sink the enemy base", maybe: you're given a position for a defended base and you need to get in and sink it

* Research

Speed of sound in water: 0.81 NM/sec

* Notes

In-game units are nautical miles and seconds

Object structure:
- <entity>
  - <rock>
  - <ship>

* Name

"Quiet Walking" is one, though the movie isn't actually about submarines. Consider: "The Hunt for Mauve July"
